There are 2 games in this project:  1. Tic Tac Toe( 3x3 )

                                    2. Open Field Tic Tac Toe (larger board)

                                    
Both the games have a common base code. Logic.py contains the actual code for the game including the minimax algorithms (minimax, depth limit, alpha beta, alpha beta with depth limit) and other classes.

Game.py has the main UI and little code work as well.

In order to play the game:

1. Install the requirements mentioned in requirements.txt using pip

2. Run the command: python Game.py 

( Make sure python in your computer is set to python3, if not run the command python3 Game.py)

3. Now that you have the game running, choose one of the games you'd like to play y clicking on it.

4. For Open Field Tic Tac Toe, enter comma separated m n and k values where m are the number of rows, n are the number of columns and k is the number required for a match( example: 4,4,3 ). For Tic Tac Toe, you don't to give any input beacuse default is set to m,n,k=3,3,3.

5. Now choose any one of the 5 search algorithms by clicking on it, the fifth algorithm being an experimental version with a different heuristic function.

6. Now you have a mxn board in front of you and you can play with the AI. Larger boards might take longer time durations to formulatea move.

7. Once the gamehas ended, you'll be taken back to the console/ terminal automatically after a couple of seconds.

A demo video showig the working proof of all algorithms for both the games is the same folder as this text file. I have avoided minixmax, depth limit and alpha-beta for larger dimensons in the video due to time constraints. Please make sure to have your AUDIO ON.
